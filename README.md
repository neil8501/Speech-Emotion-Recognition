# Speech-Emotion-Recognition

Welcome to our Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) project! Here, we embark on a journey to delve into the intricacies of human emotion through speech analysis.

Overview

In this project, we harness the power of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to discern the emotions conveyed in speech. Leveraging the rich dataset provided by Kaggle's Speech Emotion Recognition dataset, featuring diverse recordings by professional voice artists, we embark on a quest to classify emotions such as Anger, Sadness, Fear, Disgust, Happiness, Neutrality, and Surprise.

Methodology

Our approach involves meticulous data preprocessing, where we extract essential features like Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs), ensuring optimal input for our CNN architecture. To address variability in audio duration, we implement thoughtful strategies such as duration standardization and noise augmentation.

Model Development

Crafting a robust CNN model lies at the heart of our endeavor. Through iterative design and training, we sculpt a multi-layered neural network tailored for high accuracy and nuanced emotion classification. Our model undergoes rigorous evaluation, gauging performance metrics including precision, F1-score, recall, and overall accuracy.

Results

The fruits of our labor shine through impressive validation and test accuracies, standing at 96.38% and 95.86%, respectively, after 30 epochs of training. These stellar results underscore the efficacy of our CNN model in deciphering emotions from speech signals with remarkable precision.

Implications

Beyond the realms of our project, the implications of our work reverberate across diverse domains. From enhancing customer service interactions to aiding in the diagnosis of mental health conditions, our SER system holds promise for myriad applications, poised to enrich human experiences and societal well-being.

Join us as we unravel the symphony of emotions woven within every spoken word, paving the way for a future where machines truly understand the language of the heart.
